## üìÅ Projects Included

### [`Flowers`](./Flowers)
- **Description**: Classifying 10 flower species based on image data using deep learning techniques.
- **Dataset**: [Flower Classification | 10 Classes |](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/flower-classification-5-classes-roselilyetc)
- **Techniques used**: Image preprocessing, data augmentation, transfer learning (e.g. VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2), model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Goal**: Compare performance of classification models.
- **Result**: ResNet50 achieved the highest accuracy at 74.45%.

### [`Air-timeserie`](./Air_Timeserie)
- **Description**: Time series analysis and forecasting of air pollution data.
- **Dataset**: [Air Pollution Forecasting - LSTM Multivariate](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/lstm-datasets-multivariate-univariate?select=LSTM-Multivariate_pollution.csv)
- **Techniques used**: Time series preprocessing, linear regression, LSTM, and model evaluation with MAE and RMSE.
- **Goal**: Compare performance of models on air pollution data.
- **Result**: LSTM had better performance (MAE: 90.22, RMSE: 102.61) than Linear Regression on air pollution forecasting.

### [`VideoGameSales`](./VideoGameSales)
- **Description**: This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.
- **Dataset**: [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)
- **Techniques used**: feature scaling (MinMaxScaler, MaxAbsScaler), regression modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR), pipeline construction, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and model evaluation with R¬≤.
- **Goal**: Compare performance of models, perform exploratory analysis to identify sales trends by region and platform.
- **Result**:  
  - Best model: MinMaxScaler + Linear Regression (R¬≤ = 0.99998)  
  - Region with highest total sales: North America (NA)  
  - Platform with highest global sales: PlayStation 2 (PS2)
